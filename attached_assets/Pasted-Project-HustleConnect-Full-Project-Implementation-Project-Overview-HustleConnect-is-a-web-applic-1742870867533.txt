Project: HustleConnect - Full Project Implementation
Project Overview: HustleConnect is a web application that connects businesses (vendors) with users seeking jobs and products. The platform has two main account types:

Business Account: Vendors/shops who can post bids on product requests.

User Account: Individuals looking for jobs or products, where they can create requests, accept bids, and interact with businesses.

Enhancements and Features:
Business Bids on Product Posts (User Side):

In a product post created by a user, when the user clicks on “View Offers,” display a complete list of all bids submitted by businesses.

Each bid must show:

Bidder’s name and profile.

Bid amount.

Product details.

The bids should be sorted in ascending order based on the bid amount.

Display “Accepted Bids” only after a bid has been accepted by the user.

Before acceptance, bids are shown as active bids in the "View Offers" section.

Accepting and Rejecting Bids with Dynamic Updates:

Allow users to accept or reject bids from the list of active bids shown on the product post.

When a bid is accepted:

Update the bid’s status to “accepted” on the backend.

Move it into an “Accepted Bids” section, sorted by the lowest bid amount.

Notify the corresponding business that their bid has been accepted.

If the user later accepts a different bid with a lower amount than a previously accepted bid:

Update the status of the initial bid to indicate it was replaced.

Notify the previous business that the customer chose a more competitive offer.

Allow the previous bidder to revive their bid by submitting a better offer based on the new, lower accepted bid amount.

When a bid is rejected:

Provide a “Revive Bid” option for businesses to submit an improved bid for the product post.

Ensure all these status changes, including the revival of bids, are reflected dynamically across the UI and backend.

Business Bid Enhancements and Product Image Visibility:

Ensure that business users can attach an image with their bid.

On the user side, display the product image the user uploaded when creating the product post.

This allows businesses to see the product they are bidding on.

Ensure that the product post remains active for bidding until the user explicitly ends it, allowing multiple bids and subsequent bid updates.

Backend API Updates:

Update relevant API endpoints (e.g., in Server/controllers/productController.ts and associated routes) to handle:

Bid status updates.

Notifications when bids are accepted or rejected.

Display logic for product images and bids.

Ensure that when a bid is accepted or rejected, the status is updated correctly in the database.

Frontend Updates:

Modify frontend components (e.g., in Client/src/pages/ProductPostDetails.tsx) to:

Display full bid details, including the business name, quoted value, and any relevant bid details.

Include buttons for accepting, rejecting, and reviving bids.

Implement dynamic updates for the bid status (e.g., accepted bids, lowest bid tracking, etc.).

Ensure the product image provided by the user is displayed in the bidding process, so businesses can see the product.

Add proper inline comments to all new logic to clarify how the bids are displayed, sorted, updated, and revived.

User Interface (UI):

Ensure the UI is user-friendly, with intuitive design and clear buttons/icons for:

Accepting bids.

Rejecting bids.

Reviving bids.

View Details for products and bids.

The user dashboard should list all active offers, with the ability to filter by the lowest bid, job posts, or product requests.

Real-Time Updates:

Use appropriate frontend techniques (e.g., WebSockets or React state) to ensure that changes to bid status (e.g., acceptance, rejection) are reflected in real-time without the need to refresh the page.

Implement notifications to alert users and businesses when bids are accepted, rejected, or revived.

Full Project Workflow:
Business Account Features:

Registration and Login:

Users can sign up with basic business details (shop name, location, contact info, verification).

Implement dummy verification logic to auto-approve the registration.

Dashboard:

Display product request posts with bidding options.

Business users can submit bids and see a list of accepted and rejected bids.

Display product images to businesses and allow them to submit quotes with images.

User Account Features:

Job Posting and Acceptance:

Users can post jobs with job descriptions, required experience, and payment.

Jobs can be accepted, and contact details are provided to the user after acceptance.

Product Request and Acceptance:

Users can create product requests with descriptions and links.

Businesses can submit offers.

Users can accept or decline offers, with dynamic updates reflecting the lowest quoted value.

Notifications and Status Updates:

Implement notifications for users and businesses when bid statuses change.

Allow businesses to revive their bids if their initial bid is rejected in favor of a lower bid.
